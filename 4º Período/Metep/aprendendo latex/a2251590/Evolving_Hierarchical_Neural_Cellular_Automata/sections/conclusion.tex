\section{Conclusion}
We have demonstrated a significant improvement in hierarchically structured NCAs’ ability to evolve morphogenesis and homeostasis capabilities over non-hierarchical NCAs. These results underscore
the evolutionary advantage of higher-order signaling and the importance of scale in the optimization of NCAs. Our findings not only highlight the potential of HNCAs in modeling complex, multiscale systems but also open new avenues for exploring synergies between multiple spatial scales and multiple temporal scales (evolutionary, developmental and behavioral dynamics) in biological systems, and how to port those synergies usefully into multiscale artificial systems.
