abstract = {Mechanotransduction refers to the biological phenomenon wherein mechanical stresses applied to cells are translated into chemical signals that elicit adaptive responses. Mechanotransduction is involved in many critical biologic responses from vasodilation to hearing, balance, sensation of joint position, muscle contraction, and touch. In bone, mechanotransduction is central to defining the shape, mass, and strength of bone. This section considers bone mechanotransduction broadly beginning with principles of how load is applied to bone, the anatomy of bone, and molecular structure of bone and how that defines the loads experienced by bone, bone sensing cells and, finally, the system of cellular signals by which mechanical loads are translated into a biological response whereby bone is removed or accrued.}

Here, the structural definition of a cellular automaton is augmented with an abstraction operator, which transforms the cellular automaton into a hierarchy of cellular spaces. Simple propagation is used as a familiar and common behavioural phenomenon in several examples of behavioural specification. The purpose of this chapter is to provide the basics of a general framework, from which may be constructed for specific applications. Simple examples from landscape ecology are used to elucidate the methods.",

abstract = {Information-theoretic fitness functions are becoming increasingly popular to produce generally useful, task-independent behaviors. One such universal function, dubbed empowerment, measures the amount of control an agent exerts on its environment via its sensorimotor system. Specifically, empowerment attempts to maximize the mutual information between an agent's actions and its received sensor states at a later point in time. Traditionally, empowerment has been applied to a conventional sensorimotor apparatus, such as a robot. Here, we expand the approach to a distributed, multi-agent sensorimotor system embodied by a neural cellular automaton (NCA). We show that the addition of empowerment as a secondary objective in the evolution of NCA to perform the task of morphogenesis, growing and maintaining a pre-specified shape, results in higher fitness compared to evolving for morphogenesis alone. Results suggest there may be a synergistic relationship between morphogenesis and empowerment. That is, indirectly selecting for coordination between neighboring cells over the duration of development is beneficial to the developmental process itself. Such a finding may have applications in developmental biology by providing potential mechanisms of communication between cells during growth from a single cell to a multicellular, target morphology.

In these systems the dynamics of a focal cell is dependent on its neighbors and also the cell above and below it in the next coarser or finer resolution. Results from a multi-resolution version of the Game of Life show complex and unexpected behavior which is dependent on the topology chosen and initial conditions. These results and the software which produced them provide a proof of concept for the new data structure and algorithms. These may be especially useful for data analysis and simulation at the global scale.}

Here, akin to a chain reaction [20{\textendash}22], we present the discovery of hydrodynamic trigger waves in cellular communities of the protist Spirostomum ambiguum, propagating hundreds of times faster than the swimming speed. Coiling its cytoskeleton, Spirostomum can contract its long body by 50\% within milliseconds [23], with accelerations reaching 14g-forces. Surprisingly, a single cellular contraction (transmitter) is shown to generate long-ranged vortex flows at intermediate Reynolds numbers, which can trigger neighbouring cells, in turn. To measure the sensitivity to hydrodynamic signals (receiver), we further present a high-throughput suction-flow device to probe mechanosensitive ion channel gating [24] by back-calculating the microscopic forces on the cell membrane. These ultra-fast hydrodynamic trigger waves are analysed and modelled quantitatively in a universal framework of antenna and percolation theory [25, 26]. A phase transition is revealed, requiring a critical colony density to sustain collective communication. Our results suggest that this signalling could help organise cohabiting communities over large distances, influencing long-term behaviour through gene expression, comparable to quorum sensing [16]. More immediately, as contractions release toxins [27], synchronised discharges could also facilitate the repulsion of large predators, or conversely immobilise large prey. We postulate that beyond protists numerous other freshwater and marine organisms could coordinate with variations of hydrodynamic trigger waves.},

    abstract = {Hierarchical organization—the recursive composition of sub-modules—is ubiquitous in biological networks, including neural, metabolic, ecological, and genetic regulatory networks, and in human-made systems, such as large organizations and the Internet. To date, most research on hierarchy in networks has been limited to quantifying this property. However, an open, important question in evolutionary biology is why hierarchical organization evolves in the first place. It has recently been shown that modularity evolves because of the presence of a cost for network connections. Here we investigate whether such connection costs also tend to cause a hierarchical organization of such modules. In computational simulations, we find that networks without a connection cost do not evolve to be hierarchical, even when the task has a hierarchical structure. However, with a connection cost, networks evolve to be both modular and hierarchical, and these networks exhibit higher overall performance and evolvability (i.e. faster adaptation to new environments). Additional analyses confirm that hierarchy independently improves adaptability after controlling for modularity. Overall, our results suggest that the same force–the cost of connections–promotes the evolution of both hierarchy and modularity, and that these properties are important drivers of network performance and adaptability. In addition to shedding light on the emergence of hierarchy across the many domains in which it appears, these findings will also accelerate future research into evolving more complex, intelligent computational brains in the fields of artificial intelligence and robotics.},

abstract = { Brain vasculature is a complex and interconnected network under tight regulatory control that exists in intimate communication with neurons and glia. Typically, hemodynamics are considered to exclusively serve as a metabolic support system. In contrast to this canonical view, we propose that hemodynamics also play a role in information processing through modulation of neural activity. Functional hyperemia, the basis of the functional MRI (fMRI) BOLD signal, is a localized influx of blood correlated with neural activity levels. Functional hyperemia is considered by many to be excessive from a metabolic standpoint, but may be appropriate if interpreted as having an activity-dependent neuro-modulatory function. Hemodynamics may impact neural activity through direct and indirect mechanisms. Direct mechanisms include delivery of diffusible blood-borne messengers and mechanical and thermal modulation of neural activity. Indirect mechanisms are proposed to act through hemodynamic modulation of astrocytes, which can in turn regulate neural activity. These hemo-neural mechanisms should alter the information processing capacity of active local neural networks. Here, we focus on analysis of neocortical sensory processing. We predict that hemodynamics alter the gain of local cortical circuits, modulating the detection and discrimination of sensory stimuli. This novel view of information processing—that includes hemodynamics as an active and significant participant—has implications for understanding neural representation and the construction of accurate brain models. There are also potential medical benefits of an improved understanding of the role of hemodynamics in neural processing, as it directly bears on interpretation of and potential treatment for stroke, dementia, and epilepsy. }

abstract = { The concept of emergence and the related notion of ‘downward causation’ have arisen in numerous branches of science, and have also been extensively discussed in philosophy. Here, I examine emergence and downward causation in relation to evolutionary biology. I focus on the old, but ongoing discussion in evolutionary biology over the ‘levels of selection’ question: which level(s) of the biological hierarchy natural selection acts at, e.g. the gene, individual, group or species level? The concept of emergence has arisen in the levels-of-selection literature as a putative way of distinguishing between ‘true’ selection at a higher level from cases where selection acts solely at the lower level but has effects that percolate up the biological hierarchy, generating the appearance of higher level selection. At first blush, this problem seems to share a common structure with debates about emergence in other areas, but closer examination shows that it turns on issues that are sui generis to biology. }

    abstract = {As opposed to the traditional view wherein intelligence was believed to be a result of centralised complex monolithic rules, it is now believed that the phenomenon is multi-scale, modular and emergent (self-organising) in nature. At each scale, the constituents of an intelligent system are cognitive units driven towards a specific goal, in a specific problem space—physical, molecular, metabolic, morphological, etc. Recently, Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) have proven to be effective in simulating many evolutionary tasks, in morphological space, as self-organising dynamical systems. They are however limited in their capacity to emulate complex phenomena seen in nature such as cell differentiation (change in cell’s phenotypical and functional characteristics), metamorphosis (transformation to a new morphology after evolving to another) and apoptosis (programmed cell death). Inspired by the idea of multi-scale emergence of intelligence, we present Hierarchical NCA, a self-organising model that allows for phased, feedback-based, complex emergent behaviour. We show that by modelling emergent behaviour at two different scales in a modular hierarchy with dedicated goals, we can effectively simulate many complex evolutionary morphological tasks. Finally, we discuss the broader impact and application of this concept in areas outside biological process modelling.},

abstract = {Saliency detection, finding the most important parts of an image, has become increasingly popular in computer vision. In this paper, we introduce Hierarchical Cellular Automata (HCA)--a temporally evolving model to intelligently detect salient objects. HCA consists of two main components: Single-layer Cellular Automata (SCA) and Cuboid Cellular Automata (CCA). As an unsupervised propagation mechanism, Single-layer Cellular Automata can exploit the intrinsic relevance of similar regions through interactions with neighbors. Low-level image features as well as high-level semantic information extracted from deep neural networks are incorporated into the SCA to measure the correlation between different image patches. With these hierarchical deep features, an impact factor matrix and a coherence matrix are constructed to balance the influences on each cell's next state. The saliency values of all cells are iteratively updated according to a well-defined update rule. Furthermore, we propose CCA to integrate multiple saliency maps generated by SCA at different scales in a Bayesian framework. Therefore, single-layer propagation and multi-scale integration are jointly modeled in our unified HCA. Surprisingly, we find that the SCA can improve all existing methods that we applied it to, resulting in a similar precision level regardless of the original results. The CCA can act as an efficient pixel-wise aggregation algorithm that can integrate state-of-the-art methods, resulting in even better results. Extensive experiments on four challenging datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art conventional methods and is competitive with deep learning based approaches.},

abstract="We propose a multi-objective method, inspired by the Age Layered Population Structure algorithm, for avoiding premature convergence in evolutionary algorithms, and demonstrate a three-fold performance improvement over comparable methods. Previous research has shown that partitioning an evolving population into age groups can greatly improve the ability to identify global optima and avoid converging to local optima. Here, we propose that treating age as an explicit optimization criterion can increase performance even further, with fewer algorithm implementation parameters. The proposed method evolves a population on the two-dimensional Pareto front comprising (a) how long the genotype has been in the population (age); and (b) its performance (fitness). We compare this approach with previous approaches on the Symbolic Regression problem, sweeping the problem difficulty over a range of solution complexities and number of variables. Our results indicate that the multi-objective approach identifies the exact target solution more often than the age-layered population and standard population methods. The multi-objective method also performs better on higher complexity problems and higher dimensional datasets - finding global optima with less computational effort.",
